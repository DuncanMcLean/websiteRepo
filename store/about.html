		<b>Creating clothing that has relevance and meaning within our family, friends and every customer.</b>
	  </h2>
      <p id='aboutBody'>
      	<br>My store was started with idea of wearing clothing that has some personal meaning, such as my 
      	Scottish heritage. It's hard to find a local shoppe that you can walk in to and purchase unique
      	Scottish items on clothing, such as Rampant Lions, original clan names, thistles or even a few 
      	quirky Scottish expressions. That was my inspiration that helped transform this store into what 
      	it is becoming.<br><br>

	    	Then I opened it up to family, friends and even a few buyers right here on ESTY for their take on
	    	their heritage or favorite items they would fancy on clothes that we're unique or even quirky!<br><br>

    		My wife has taken off with the baby outfits and truly has just begun to scratch the surface being
	    	that there are literally hundreds of ideas to go with !
		    Our youngest son has jumped in with his photography hobby and helped with some of the tattoo
		    pictures, he got a new camera and can zoom up for high quality pictures and also suggests new
	    	tattoos ideas (mostly the young and trendy ones!). He also is a Computer Science major and 
    		created this entire website by himself (and is also the one wrtiting this). <br><br>

    		Our middle son has an outgoing personality and he has created some of the funnier novelty 
		    shirts! Although he doesn't really care for the Roswell Alien much (since he was young) it's
    		interesting that this would turn out to be our number one seller LOL!
    		Our family has been watching the page since we started and contribute some great ideas, which we
    		have created and posted and they just keep coming with the ideas, which is fantastic because 
	    	that's the premise behind the page, to add in everyone's personality & interests and now our 
		    friends and customers have collaborated with us as well.
		    We're pleased we have started this little store and are having fun and truly get excited when we
		    have a sale. <br><br>
		    Thanks again everyone for creating , buying & sharing this new adventure with us. 
		    Drop us a note if you think you have an idea and we'll run with it!
